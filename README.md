25-Line-RPG
===========

As part of a challenge, this is a text RPG written in Python in 25 lines of code, no semicolons.
I managed to add a town, currency, leveling, randomly generated quests, combat, and a few enemies

No it is not Pythonic, or good code, but that was bound to happen with the given challenge
